## Task 1

Enter number n, print the sum of even numbers of the numbers up to n ex.

for n=10 (10+8+6+4+2)=30

## Task 2

Enter a number n and (single digit) k.
Use **recursive** function to mark the digits from N  which less or equal to k to be 0,  to mark the digits of N which greater than K with 1.
```
CONDITION 1: digit<=k -> 0
CONDITION 2: digit>k  -> 1
```
INPUT: `77134 5`
OUTPUT: `11000`

## Task 3

Use a recursive void function  void printCharacters(char c, bool backwards).
*Print all the characters of the alphabet from that char c regarding of the
*value of the bool backwards

INPUT : `c 0`
OUTPUT: `cba`
