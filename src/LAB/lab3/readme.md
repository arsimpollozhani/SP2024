### Task 1

## ðŸ”¢ Task: Count Occurrences of a Digit

Write a program that reads two inputs from **standard input (SI)**:
- `a`: a sequence of digits (can be considered as a string)
- `b`: a single digit from **0 to 9**

Your goal is to count how many times the digit `b` appears in the number `a`.

`Input`
- A string of digits `a` (e.g., `"12334"`)
- A single digit `b` (e.g., `"3"`)

`Output`
- A single integer representing the number of times digit `b` appears in `a`

Input: 12334 3
Output: 2



### Task 2


Write a C++ program that reads characters from standard input **one at a time** and interprets them as binary digits (`0` or `1`). The program should:

- Convert the valid binary sequence into its **decimal** equivalent.
- Stop reading input as soon as a non-binary digit (i.e., not `0` or `1`) is encountered.
- Output the decimal value of the binary number read so far.

Input: `1 0 1 x`

Output: `5`
