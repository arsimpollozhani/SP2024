## Character Arrays

### Task 1

Write a function that will find how many times a given character occurs in given string.

Example

For the string

`HELLO FINKI`

character `L` occurs 2 times.

### Task 2

Write a function that will return the length of a string.

Also write a recursive solution.

Example

For string

`zdravo!`

it should return: `7`


### Task 3

Write a program that will print substring from given string, determined with the position and the length as parameters read from SI. The substring starts from the character on the position counted from left to right.

Example

For the string:

`banana`

position: `2`

length: `4`

the output is: `nana`

### Task 4

Write a function that will check if one string is substring of some other string.

Example

the result should be:

`VEpRMr`

### Task 8

Write a function that will trim a string (remove blanks at front and end of string).
