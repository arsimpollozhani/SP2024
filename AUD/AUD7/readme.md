## Arrays

### Task 1

Write a program that will check whether two arrays are equal or not. Display the result of the comparison on the screen. The maximum size of the arrays is 100.

### Task 2

Write a program that, for an array whose elements are entered from the keyboard, calculates the sum of even elements, the sum of odd elements, and the ratio between the number of even and odd elements. Print the results to the screen.

Example:

For the array:` 3 2 7 6 2 5 1 `, the output should be:

```
Sum even: 8
Sum odd: 16
Rel: 0.75
```

### Task 3

Write a program that calculates the scalar product of two vectors with n coordinates. The number of coordinates n, as well as the coordinates of the vectors, are entered from the standard input. Print the result to the screen.


### Task 4

Write a program that checks if a given array of n elements, read from the standard input, is strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing. Print the result to the screen.


### Task 5

Write a program to rotate the elements of an array one place to the right. Finally, print the rotated array to the screen. Read the elements of the array from the standard input.

### Task 6

Write a program to rotate the elements of an array `m` places to the right. Finally, print the rotated array

to the screen. Read the elements of the array and the number of rotations from the standard input.

### Task 7 ***

Write a program that removes duplicates from an array. Finally, print the obtained array to the screen. Read the elements of the array from the standard input.
