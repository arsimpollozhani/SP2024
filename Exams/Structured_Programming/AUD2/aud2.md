## Basics of C++

### Task 1

Write a program that reads an uppercase letter from the standard input and prints the same letter as lowercase. 

- Note: Each character is represented by an ASCII number.

### Task 2

Write a program that reads the price of a product from the keyboard and then prints its price with added value-added tax (VAT).

Hint: VAT is `18%` of the initial price.

### Task 3

Write a program that reads the price of a product, the number of installments, and the interest rate (the interest rate is a number expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100). The program should print the installment amount and the total amount to be paid for the product.

Hint: Calculate the total amount and then the installment.

### Task 4

Write a program that reads a three-digit integer from the keyboard. The program should print the most significant and least significant digits of the number.

Example: If you enter the number `795`, the program will print: The most significant digit is `7`, and the least significant is `5`.


### Task 5

Write a program that reads a date in the format (ddmmyyyy) from the keyboard. The program should print the day and the month of the birthdate.

Example: If you enter the number `18091992`, the program will print: `18.9`
